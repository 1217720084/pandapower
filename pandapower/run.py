    INPUT:
        **net** - The Pandapower format network

    Optional:
    
        **init** (str, "flat") - initialization method of the loadflow
        Pandapower supports three methods for initializing the loadflow:

            - "flat"- flat start with voltage of 1.0pu and angle of 0Â° at all buses as initial solution
            - "dc" - initial DC loadflow before the AC loadflow. The results of the DC loadflow are used as initial solution for the AC loadflow.
            - "results" - voltage vector of last loadflow from net.res_bus is used as initial solution. This can be useful to accelerate convergence in iterative loadflows like time series calculations.

        **calculate_voltage_angles** (bool, False) - consider voltage angles in loadflow calculation
        
            If True, voltage angles are considered in the  loadflow calculation. In some cases with
            large differences in voltage angles (for example in case of transformers with high
            voltage shift), the difference between starting and end angle value is very large.
            In this case, the loadflow might be slow or it might not converge at all. That is why 
            the possibility of neglecting the voltage angles of transformers and ext_grids is
            provided to allow and/or accelarate convergence for networks where calculation of 
            voltage angles is not necessary. Note that if calculate_voltage_angles is True the
            loadflow is initialized with a DC power flow (init = "dc")
            
            The default value is False because pandapower was developed for distribution networks.
            Please be aware that this parameter has to be set to True in meshed network for correct
            results!

        **tolerance_kva** (float, 1e-5) - loadflow termination condition referring to P / Q mismatch of node power in kva
        
        **trafo_model** (str, "t")  - transformer equivalent circuit model
        Pandapower provides two equivalent circuit models for the transformer:

            - "t" - transformer is modelled as equivalent with the T-model. This is consistent with PowerFactory and is also more accurate than the PI-model. We recommend using this transformer model.
            - "pi" - transformer is modelled as equivalent PI-model. This is consistent with Sincal, but the method is questionable since the transformer is physically T-shaped. We therefore recommend the use of the T-model. 

        **trafo_loading** (str, "current") - mode of calculation for transformer loading
        
            Transformer loading can be calculated relative to the rated current or the rated power. In both cases the overall transformer loading is defined as the maximum loading on the two sides of the transformer.

            - "current"- transformer loading is given as ratio of current flow and rated current of the transformer. This is the recommended setting, since thermal as well as magnetic effects in the transformer depend on the current.
            - "power" - transformer loading is given as ratio of apparent power flow to the rated apparent power of the transformer. 

        **enforce_q_lims** (bool, False) - respect generator reactive power limits
        
            If True, the reactive power limits in net.gen.max_q_kvar/min_q_kvar are respected in the
            loadflow. This is done by running a second loadflow if reactive power limits are
            violated at any generator, so that the runtime for the loadflow will increase if reactive
            power has to be curtailed.

        **suppress_warnings** (bool, True) - suppress warnings in pypower
        
            If set to True, warnings are disabled during the loadflow. Because of the way data is
            processed in pypower, ComplexWarnings are raised during the loadflow. These warnings are
            suppressed by this option, however keep in mind all other pypower warnings are also suppressed.

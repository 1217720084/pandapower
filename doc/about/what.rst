What is pandapower?
================================
    
pandapower
    - provides a flexible datastructure for comprehensive modeling of electric power systems
    - comes with static electric models for lines, switches, generators, 2/3 winding transformers, ward equivalents etc. 
    - is a tool for static and quasi-static power system analysis
    
pandapower allows you to
    - automize the creation of complex power system models
    - solve three phase AC, DC and optimal power flow problems
    - carry out topological searches in electric networks
    - plot structural and/or geographical network plans

pandapower does not yet support:
    - static short circuit calculation (in development)
    - unbalanced power flow problems
    - RMS simulation
    
pandapower does not, and most likely never will, support:
    - transient network simulation
    - analysis of dynamic network stability

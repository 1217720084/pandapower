The general workflow when approaching simulation of controlled elements within pandapower
could be outlined like this:

    1. Get an overview of your project. Which network elements do you need, what and how should these elements accomplish their task?

    2. Checkout current implementations. Maybe there is a controller that does something similar, so you can save work and also get a point to start with.

    3. Implement your own controller/controlling-strategy.

    4. Setup your simulation and give it a go.

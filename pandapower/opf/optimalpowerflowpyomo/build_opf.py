    limits (C{zl, zu}) can also be specified as fields in a case dict,
    either passed in directly or defined in a case file referenced by name.

    When specified, C{A, l, u} represent additional linear constraints on the
    optimization variables, C{l <= A*[x z] <= u}. If the user specifies an C{A}
    matrix that has more columns than the number of "C{x}" (OPF) variables,
    then there are extra linearly constrained "C{z}" variables. For an
    explanation of the formulation used and instructions for forming the
    C{A} matrix, see the MATPOWER manual.

    A generalized cost on all variables can be applied if input arguments
    C{N}, C{fparm}, C{H} and C{Cw} are specified. First, a linear transformation
    of the optimization variables is defined by means of C{r = N * [x z]}.
    Then, to each element of C{r} a function is applied as encoded in the
    C{fparm} matrix (see MATPOWER manual). If the resulting vector is named
    C{w}, then C{H} and C{Cw} define a quadratic cost on w:
    C{(1/2)*w'*H*w + Cw * w}. C{H} and C{N} should be sparse matrices and C{H}
    should also be symmetric.

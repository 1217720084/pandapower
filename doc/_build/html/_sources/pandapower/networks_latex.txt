Besides creating your own grids in pandapower you can use the networks modul as well.
The pandapower networks modul contains the (in)famous Kerber networks, CIGRE networks and randomly generated pandapower networks which can be used for testing.
Additionally you can use IEEE case networks.


You can find documentation for the individual modules here:
